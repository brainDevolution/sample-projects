# Red-Academy-Project-2

This project is the second part to an intoductory website written with HTML CSS and JavaScript. 

The second part to this project had a few design challenges. The margin spacing between flexed items in the new bar created problems, introducing a top margin doesnt seem to work for flexed items and I couldn't find a way around this. Additionally the e-mail subscribe bar was still very frustrating.

HTML and structure seemed better for this project. Still encountered a few errors with validation that couldn't get around fixing without the whole project collapsing.

JavaScript was minimal for this project but difficult to fiddle with. Encountered problems with flickity and the text centering. Major problems trying to fiddle with smooth scroll. Went through dozens of plugins to try and get it working but couldn't figure it out. 

@media queries are set to 600px and 1240px. Had problems with flex order trying to get the middle bar to fall onto the bottom for mobile size. Tried changing the order and then pushing it down for the mobile screen but it kept butchering the rest of the screen sizes.
